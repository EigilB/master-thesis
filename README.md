Interpretable Neural Networks for Power System Security Assessment

This projected is the master thesis work by Eigil Bagger at DTU Cognitive Systems and DTU Power Systems.
It is concerned with
(1) Creating datasets for a 9-bus and a 118-bus power system with binary classification accoridng to the N-1 security criterion
(2) Training and hyperparameter-optimizing different networks on the DTU cluster
(3) Performing uncertainty estimation of feed-forward NNs, BNNs, MC-Dropout and non-Bayesian Deep Ensembles
(4) Producing attribution maps using Integrated Gradients, Expected Gradients, LRP and DeepLIFT with different baselines.

Due to the GitHub size limitations, the models and the 118-bus data cannot be uploaded to this GitHub. I'll find a way to upload them later
